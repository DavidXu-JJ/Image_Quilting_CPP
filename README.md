## Development Environment

MacOS 10.15

## How to run:

```
make all
make run [ARGS="[-i input_path] [-o output_path] [-p patch_size] [-v overlap_ratio] [-s scale] [-t tolerance] [-n n_iter]"]
```

`[ ]` means optional, you can run through `make run`, `make run ARGS="-p 20"`, `make run ARGS="-p 20 -s 5"`. Anyone of them is runable.

## Argument for Executable:

- `-i` for input image path.
- `-o` for output image path.

## Simple Example:

Input image:

<img class="myImage" src="input/case1.png" /> <img class="myImage" src="input/case2.png" /> <img class="myImage" src="input/case3.png" />

Output synthesized image:

<img class="myImage" src="output/case1.png" /> <img class="myImage" src="output/case2.png" /> <img class="myImage" src="output/case3.png" />

## Note

The effect may varies with respect to our definition on patch size, error tolrence and max iteration. I haven't tested proper parameters for each case. Maybe you can try on different parameters for better results.
